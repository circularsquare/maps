each region contains a million people, to within 5% of the last census or government published estimate. the projection is albers equal area.

i drew the lines trying to respect
	- 1 million people
	- linguistic boundaries
	- mountain ranges 
	- existing political borders
	- historical political borders 
	- rivers
	- urban/rural divide
in roughly this order.

the colors don't strictly mean anything, they were mostly just what i thought would look nice, but i also tried to make these line up with colors that have been associated with these regions, or colors from eu4.

and for the names, i tried to draw on a mix of cities, historical region names, mountain ranges, and rivers, depending on what i thought was closest to a shared characteristic of the whole region.

the little + symbols are what i thought could be hypothetical capital cities. 

i used asesprite to draw. i used citypopulation.de for convenient access to subdivision census data. i used geopandas and simplemaps to draw coastlines and place cities.

feedback is welcomed! please let me know if you think i messed up where you live

note: ukraine uses pre-war population estimates because there haven't been any estimates since. this means some ukrainian refugees and migrants are double counted in countries that have had censuses in the past 2 years.
